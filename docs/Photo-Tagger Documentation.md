## 2025-10-23 â€“ Tags Page Documentation & QA Collateral

### Highlights
- Expanded `docs/user_guide.md` with full CLI reference, gallery/tags walkthroughs, medoids review, RAW ingestion tips, and tag promotion workflows.
- Added dedicated QA assets for the Tags page revamp:
  - `docs/tags_page_qa_checklist.md` covering functional, UX, performance, accessibility, and regression scenarios.
  - `docs/tags_page_qa_findings.md` template for structured issue logging with severity and follow-up tracking.
  - `docs/qa_process_README.md` describing the step-by-step QA workflow, troubleshooting tips, and resources.
- Introduced `scripts/capture_screenshots.py` to capture reproducible UI screenshots and generate Markdown snippets with contextual notes.

### Purpose
- Ensure operators and QA reviewers have up-to-date guidance before running the enhanced Tags workflows.
- Provide repeatable assets (checklists, findings template, screenshot tooling) to accelerate testing once fresh pipeline runs are ready.

### Next Steps
- Schedule a QA session after regenerating run data so the new collateral can be exercised end-to-end.
- Fold collected findings back into `docs/tags_page_qa_findings.md` and surface any required fixes in `docs/ongoing.md`.
