# Gallery Status Screenshots (Placeholder)

Actual screenshot capture is blocked in this environment (no X server). Use the following checklist when capturing on a workstation:

1. View Gallery (All) and capture summary chips.
2. Toggle each stage (New, Needs tags, Draft, Saved, Blocked) and capture cards/counts.
3. Exercise filter toggles (Medoids only, Only unapproved, Hide saved).
4. Confirm infinite scroll reveals additional cards.

When ready, run `python scripts/capture_screenshots.py --feature gallery_status --auto` to generate real assets.
