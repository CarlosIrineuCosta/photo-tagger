# Photo Tagger System Evaluation and Improvement Plan

## Current System Assessment

### Core Purpose
Photo Tagger is designed to help users efficiently tag large photo collections using CLIP embeddings, with a focus on:
1. Automated tagging of images using AI models
2. User review and approval workflow
3. Export to standard formats (CSV, XMP sidecars)
4. Medoid selection for quality assessment

### Identified Workflow Issues

#### 1. File State Management and Filtering Logic
**Problem**: Current filtering logic is confusing and doesn't clearly communicate file states to users.

**Current Issues**:
- Filter states are unclear (approved, unapproved, saved)
- XOR logic between filters creates confusion
- Users don't understand what still needs action
- "Hide saved" filter behavior is ambiguous

**Recommended Solution**:
```yaml
File States:
  never_processed:
    description: "New files not yet processed"
    actions: ["process"]
    ui_state: "unprocessed"

  processed_not_saved:
    description: "Tagged but not yet saved"
    actions: ["review", "save", "discard"]
    ui_state: "pending_review"

  saved:
    description: "Tagged and saved to export"
    actions: ["export", "reprocess"]
    ui_state: "completed"

Filter Options:
  show_all: "Display all files"
  needs_action: "Show files needing user action"
  unprocessed_only: "Show only new files"
  completed_only: "Show only saved files"
```

#### 2. New File Detection and Processing
**Problem**: System needs better handling when new files are added to existing folders.

**Recommended Solution**:
```python
# File monitoring service
class FileMonitor:
    def __init__(self, watch_directories):
        self.watched_dirs = set(watch_directories)
        self.last_scan = {}

    def check_for_new_files(self):
        current_files = self.scan_directories()
        new_files = []

        for directory in self.watched_dirs:
            if directory not in self.last_scan:
                new_files.extend(current_files.get(directory, []))
                continue

            previous_files = set(self.last_scan.get(directory, []))
            current_dir_files = set(current_files.get(directory, []))

            # Find new files
            files_added = current_dir_files - previous_files
            if files_added:
                new_files.extend([(directory, f) for f in files_added])

        self.last_scan = current_files
        return new_files

    def prompt_user_for_reprocessing(self, new_files):
        if not new_files:
            return None

        message = f"Found {len(new_files)} new file(s) in monitored directories.\n"
        for directory, files in new_files:
            message += f"  {directory}: {len(files)} file(s)\n"

        message += "\nProcessing options:\n"
        message += "1. Process only new files (recommended)\n"
        message += "2. Reprocess entire directory\n"
        message += "3. Skip for now\n"

        return message
```

#### 3. Large File Handling
**Problem**: System needs clear policy for handling very large files (e.g., >1GB TIFF files).

**Recommended Solution**:
```python
# File size validation
class FileSizeValidator:
    MAX_SIZE_GB = 1.0  # Configurable limit

    @staticmethod
    def validate_file(file_path):
        size_gb = os.path.getsize(file_path) / (1024**3)
        return size_gb <= FileSizeValidator.MAX_SIZE_GB

    @staticmethod
    def handle_oversized_file(file_path):
        size_gb = os.path.getsize(file_path) / (1024**3)

        options = [
            "Process anyway (may take very long)",
            "Generate thumbnail only",
            "Skip this file",
            "Convert to smaller format first"
        ]

        return {
            "file": file_path,
            "size_gb": size_gb,
            "max_size_gb": FileSizeValidator.MAX_SIZE_GB,
            "options": options
        }
```

#### 4. Thumbnail Generation and RAW Processing
**Problem**: Need better handling of XMP sidecar corrections during thumbnail generation.

**Recommended Solution**:
```python
# Enhanced thumbnail generation with XMP awareness
class ThumbnailGenerator:
    def __init__(self, apply_corrections=True):
        self.apply_corrections = apply_corrections

    def generate_thumbnail(self, image_path):
        # Check for XMP sidecar with corrections
        xmp_path = image_path + ".xmp"
        if self.apply_corrections and os.path.exists(xmp_path):
            # Apply light correction before thumbnail generation
            corrected_image = self.apply_xmp_corrections(image_path, xmp_path)
            return self.generate_from_image(corrected_image)
        else:
            return self.generate_from_image(image_path)

    def apply_xmp_corrections(self, image_path, xmp_path):
        # Parse XMP and apply light/contrast corrections
        # Implementation depends on XMP library
        pass
```

#### 5. Lazy Loading and Pagination
**Problem**: Need efficient loading for large collections (10K+ files).

**Recommended Solution**:
```typescript
// Frontend lazy loading implementation
interface GalleryState {
  loadedFiles: ImageFile[]
  totalCount: number
  pageSize: number
  currentPage: number
  isLoading: boolean
}

const useLazyLoading = (pageSize: number = 100) => {
  const [loadedFiles, setLoadedFiles] = useState<ImageFile[]>([])
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(0)
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)

  const loadMoreFiles = async () => {
    if (isLoading || loadedFiles.length >= totalCount) return

    setIsLoading(true)
    const nextPage = currentPage + 1
    const newFiles = await fetchFiles(nextPage, pageSize)

    setLoadedFiles(prev => [...prev, ...newFiles])
    setCurrentPage(nextPage)
    setIsLoading(false)
  }

  return { loadedFiles, loadMoreFiles, isLoading, hasMore: loadedFiles.length < totalCount }
}
```

#### 6. Medoid Calculation Logic
**Problem**: Need more robust medoid calculation for varied folder structures.

**Recommended Solution**:
```python
# Enhanced medoid calculation
class MedoidCalculator:
    def __init__(self, min_cluster_size=3, max_medoids_per_folder=10):
        self.min_cluster_size = min_cluster_size
        self.max_medoids_per_folder = max_medoids_per_folder

    def calculate_medoids(self, folder_embeddings, folder_structure):
        # Analyze folder structure uniformity
        uniformity_score = self.analyze_structure_uniformity(folder_structure)

        # Adjust strategy based on uniformity
        if uniformity_score > 0.8:
            # Uniform structure - use folder-based medoids
            return self.calculate_folder_medoids(folder_embeddings)
        else:
            # Mixed structure - use clustering
            return self.calculate_cluster_medoids(folder_embeddings)

    def analyze_structure_uniformity(self, folder_structure):
        # Analyze how consistent the folder structure is
        # Implementation depends on specific needs
        pass
```

#### 7. VPS Deployment Preparation
**Problem**: Need to prepare system for GPU-less VPS deployment.

**Recommended Solution**:
```python
# VPS optimization configuration
class VPSConfig:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cpu_only_mode = True
        self.batch_size = 4  # Reduced for CPU
        self.max_concurrent_jobs = 2
        self.temp_dir = "/tmp/photo-tagger"

    def optimize_for_cpu(self):
        return {
            "model": "ViT-B-32-quickgelu",  # Smaller model
            "batch_size": self.batch_size,
            "precision": "fp16",  # Half precision
            "max_workers": self.max_concurrent_jobs
        }
```

#### 8. Online LLM Integration
**Problem**: Need architecture for future online LLM tag enhancement.

**Recommended Solution**:
```python
# LLM enhancement service
class LLMTagEnhancer:
    def __init__(self, api_key, model="gpt-4-vision-preview"):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.model = model

    def enhance_tags(self, image_path, initial_tags):
        # Send image and initial tags to LLM
        # Get back enhanced, filtered tags
        enhanced_tags = self.call_llm_api(image_path, initial_tags)

        # Merge with confidence scores
        return self.merge_with_confidence(initial_tags, enhanced_tags)

    def call_llm_api(self, image_path, initial_tags):
        # Implementation depends on LLM provider
        pass
```

#### 9. Tags Page UI Improvements
**Problem**: Current tags page will become unwieldy with hundreds of tags.

**Recommended Solution**:
```typescript
// Enhanced tags management UI
interface TagManagementState {
  tags: Tag[]
  filteredTags: Tag[]
  viewMode: 'pills' | 'table' | 'tree'
  selectedTags: string[]
  bulkMode: boolean
}

const useTagManagement = () => {
  // Implement efficient filtering, search, and bulk operations
  // Add tag hierarchy visualization
  // Include drag-and-drop for reorganization
}
```
